# TicTacToe-Node.js-WebServer
*This was a School Project!*

**A Node.js Webserver using Websockets where you can host your very own Tic Tac Toe game!**

*Note that the Game is straith up broken, where the game doesnt end when its suppost to :( , the game is however still playable by just reseting if someone wins!
If anyone could find the issue that would be great(!), i for the life of me cant figure it out.*
